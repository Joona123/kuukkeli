# Kuukkeli

The source code for Kuukkeli, the worst search engine ever, is available at http://github.com/Joona123/kuukkeli

## Requirements

Absolutely none. 

## License

Kuukkeli is on the public domain. Use however you want, you don't have to ask any permissions. You can also change the source code if you want. I don't care.

(But WHY would you ever want to use this for anything? It was my first actual HTML project from years ago, and SUCKS.)
